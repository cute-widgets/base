Badges are small count and labeling components that scale to match the size of the immediate parent element by using relative font sizing and `em` units. 
Badges have no focus or hover styles for links.

### Styling
For proper styling, use the `color` input property. The `roundedPill` property makes a badge more rounded with a larger border-radius.
